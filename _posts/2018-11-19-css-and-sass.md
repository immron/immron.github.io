What do i think of precompiling css and static site generators?

The advantages are, of course, that it's very quick, especially for someone not very experienced.
You get a decent-looking site with a pretty clear site structure. Changing things around
does not seem to be that difficult either. The documentation on the Jekyllrnb site is pretty helpful,
even if some things seem to differ a bit. Maybe due to me doing things via git/vsc. 

As for techniques, i don't really know. I just followed a vlog to get started and then experimented a bit.
