<h1> On Robots and Humans </h1>

The robots.txt and humans.txt are special files not usually noticable/linked in the index. robots.txt contains
information for the bots that trawl the web, telling it what directories to avoid. Note that this does not block
it, it's more of a polite "Please do not go here". It should logically follow, then, that a non-malicious programmer will
write their bot in such a way as to heed the instructions in the robots.txt.

humans.txt is a document where the authors of the website can say "Hey, my name is X and i wrote this!" 
While reading up on it, i tried it with a few different pages. github links it to the "about" page, google says
"this thing is huge, wanna work for us? go to the careers section". Jekyllrnb does not have one.  
Humanstxt.org has one. No surprise there.

This site also has one.

My robots.txt is set to disallow robots from the server. 
Why? Why not.
