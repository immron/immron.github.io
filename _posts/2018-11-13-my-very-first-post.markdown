So this is the first post. Hurrah. So far it seems pretty simple. Most of the work
has already been done and a robust framework has been implemented. Obviously this saves us 
a lot of time, and time = money. 

Can't say i understand everything about sass and jekyll but enough to make this post. 
Good start, i suppose.
