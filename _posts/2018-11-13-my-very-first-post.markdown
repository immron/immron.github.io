So this is the first post. Hurrah. So far it seems pretty simple. Most of the work
has already been done and a robust framework has been implemented. Obviously this saves us 
a lot of time, and time = money. 

Can't say i understand everything about sass and jekyll but enough to make this post. 
Good start, i suppose. 

<h1> On Robots and Humans </h1>

The robots.txt and humans.txt are special files not usually noticable/linked in the index. robots.txt contains
information for the bots that trawl the web, telling it what directories to avoid. Note that this does not block
it, it's more of a polite "Please do not go here". It should logically follow, then, that a non-malicious programmer will
write their bot in such a way as to heed the instructions in the robots.txt.

humans.txt is a document where the authors of the website can say "Hey, my name is X and i wrote this!"
